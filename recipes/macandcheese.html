                <li>¼ cup all-purpose flour </li>
                <li>½ teaspoon salt </li>

            <ol>
                <li>Bring a large pot of lightly salted water to a boil. Cook elbow macaroni in the boiling water, stirring occasionally until cooked through but firm to the bite, 8 minutes. </li>
